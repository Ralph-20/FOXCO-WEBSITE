            <p> Explain Paine’s view on revelation as described in Chapter II of The Age of Reason. He says that it is illogical. He said that a revelation is when god talks to one man, only that one man, and if he talks to more then one then it is no longer a revelation. But if he only talks to one why should other people believe him?
                Summarize the links Paine makes between Christian belief and “heathen mythology” in Chapter II. He said that there are little to no differences to them, Christianity came from a part of heathen mythology, he said the Christian theory is little else other than the idolatry of ancient mythologists. 
               What does Paine believe is the “true theology” (699)? Explain. Natural Philosophy because it follows science closely and astronomy, “the true works of god”
