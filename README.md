# FOXCO-WEBSITE


So this was a project to help a family friend out and to expand his business outreach ! 
It was a lot of fun and I am still tweaking and adding things here and there, but nothing's 
perfect but this was a great opportunity and I certainly learned a lot from it. Improving my 
html skills and learned a lot about how different files and pages should be structured, to improve 
readability. Got lots of hands on experience with css and learned just how much I love flex-box and grid 
displays, they make everything so much easier. And got some hands on experience with javascript 
and created a working slideshow and hope to implement a different styled side bar in the future. 

Overall, was a great project and lots of fun, super great learning experience !!!!

I hope this expands Andy's Buisness outreach
